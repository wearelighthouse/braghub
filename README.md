# BragHub
*A Lighthouse programming exercise*

## The task

Github has both private and public repositories and you would like to use these to dynamically create a portolio page on your website. Using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and PHP create an application that accommoplishes this task. You may use any frameworks and other tech that you feel are necassary, although you will need to justify your choices!

### Must haves

- [ ] A page displaying your GitHub repositories in some manner (left up to you!). This should include both private and public repositries. N.B. you will need to authenticate with the API to list your private respositories.

### Optional but suggested!

- [ ] You don't want to show all of your repositories but would prefer to select which ones are displayed. Implement a way to make this possible!

## Some other instructions

* Fork this repository and start coding your solution
* This is **not** intended to be a closed book test, we just want to get the "gist" of where you are at with programming and how you break down a problem
* **Don't** spend hours on this its intended to be a quick task!
* We like things to look pretty but at the end of the day that won't be your job so feel free to use libraries like Bootstrap.

If you have any questions or run into a wall and need a hand feel free to shoot me (christy@wearelighthouse.com) an email.
